# AndresWorkshop

This is a space I created in 2015 when I was trying to figure out what the heck Github was all about.  

I had zero experience in coding and was in between my first and second year of law school.  

I understood that creating law school outlines in code would be an efficient way to synthesize and teach myself the law, but I felt **overwhelmed** and had no idea where to begin. 

I was also reading lots about blockchain, which was also overwhelming but very exciting. 

Difficulty in lawyering often lurks in structuring your document (brief, memo, email to client, etc.) in a logical, structurally sound way.  Organizing a legal argument into machine readable langauge makes so much sense.  At least for the outline portion, or the table of contents section.  

Why aren't we teaching law students how to write legal briefs in markdown, I ask?  Using markdown encourages compartmentalization of the separate legal issues.  This allows the student's ideas about each separate issue to come to fruition individually.  At that point, they can step back and look at all three (or however many) points and realize where the second-level arguments are to be made.

This is my personal Github repo where I "learn by doing" while preventing myself from 1) repeating mistakes in the future, and 2) harming anyone else's code
