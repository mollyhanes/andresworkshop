# AndresWorkshop

This is a space I created in 2015 when I was trying to figure out what the heck Github was all about.  

I had zero experience in coding and was in between my first and second year of law school.  

I understood the concept of being able to create law school outlines in code would be really valuable, but I felt **overwhelmed** and had no idea where to begin. 

I was also reading lots about blockchain.  

Which was also overwhelming.

But exciting!

Now I am mastering markdown and can't wait to learn new languages like Python.  Talk about making the law and code work together!

Also Andr√© is my dog! :dog:
