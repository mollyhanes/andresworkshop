# AndresWorkshop

## This is a space I created in 2015 when I was trying to figure out what the heck Github was all about.  

I had zero experience in coding and was in between my first and second year of law school. I was reading lots about bitcoin and blockchain and appreciated the impact distributed ledgers would inevitably have on the law, policy, and the global community as a whole.   

I understood that creating law school outlines in code would be an efficient way to synthesize and teach myself the law, but I felt *overwhelmed* and had no idea where to begin. I badly wanted to write a case brief or a draft of my moot court argument in Github but did not know how or where to start.  

>I was overwhelmed with the concept of organizing the law into one big website and I knew my fellow law students would laugh at me if I asked them to join me in writing some **simple code** that would actually **help us to help each other** understand what we were reading (equally laughable concepts in law school).
>>Plus, we had bigger fish to fry...dealing with the dumpster fire that one misplaced parenthese in an appellate brief potentially created (page limit exceeded, can't recover saved version, printer goes down,  roman numerals thrown off, fear-anxiety triggered... technological sabotage at its finest). 

**I digress** but my point is that I was not brave enough to step out on my own and make outlines in Github.

**Knowing now (near the end of 2017) what I know about the ease of markdown, I regret that lack of action.**

Difficulty in lawyering often lurks in structuring your document (brief, memo, email to client, etc.) in a logical, structurally sound way.  Organizing a legal argument into machine readable code makes so much sense...for outlining, for organizing a legal brief, for fleshing out WTF proximate cause means....etc. 

Why aren't we teaching law students how to write legal briefs in markdown, I ask?  

Using a simple language like markdown to draft documents encourages compartmentalization of the separate legal issues, allowing ideas to come to fruition individually.  Teaching a law student code forces them to stop and smell the roses.  At each stage of the legal document construction process.  

As each set of roses is sniffed, the student steps back and decides how and where second-level arguments are to be made.  The skill of advocacy blooms as knowledge is built on top of knowledge.  

>Teaching law students a language like markdown encourages spoon-feeding which in turn encourages synthesis which in turn encourages fork-feeding.  :grimacing:

Also Andr√© is my dog! :dog:

This is my personal Github repo where I "learn by doing" while preventing myself from: 1) repeating mistakes in the future, and 2) harming anyone else's code.
