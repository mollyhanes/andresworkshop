## PIMENTO CHEESE

*Grate a 1lb block off sharp cheddar
>much easier to do with food processor shred attachment than by hand 

*Add a big spoon full of mayo (i use smart balance)

*Add about 4oz of cream cheese (softened at room temp)

*throw in a big jar (or 2 small) of pimentos...make sure you get DICED and not sliced pimentos...

*1-2 jalapenos, seeded if you can't take the heat

*cover the whole bowl with sprinkling of garlic powder and onion powder

*then 1 capfuls of Dale's Seasoning Sauce (i use the reduced sodium... it comes in a plastic bottle near the soy sauce/worstechire sauce and has a little cartoon doggie on it. 

*If you use the food processer, then after you grate the cheese, dump it into a bowl and incorporate ingredients, its prettier that way.  

*adjust the mayo/cream cheese until you like the consistency.  Remember if all your stuff is room temp it will be softer- so don't overdo the mayo...easy to do.  Everything will get really firm in the fridge.
